####- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
	To create a repository all you need to do is click on the + icon next to your profile picutre on Github.com and select create repository. To clone the repository you need to locate the SSH clone URL which is on the right side of the repositories page when you open it. Highlight the url and copy it. Next open up terminal and change the directory to the location you want to clone your repository to. Finally, type in "git clone (SSH URL)" and there you go!

####- Describe what open source means.
	Open source is someones source code which is posted online for anyone to view. Along with viewing, anyone can modify the existing code and try to improve upon the existing code. The existing code is their to be manipulated by other users in a calabrative effort.


####- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
	I think that open source is awesome and I have used many programs that are open source software before. It doesn't make me nervous or protective. Yes in a way it does feel like a utopia

####- Assess the importance of using licenses.
	Licenses are important becasue of two main reasons. One is without a licensens anyone can take your software and claim it as their own without having to give the creator credit for it. Another reason is that you can charge people to gain access to the software. This is a great way to make money and still keep the integrity of your software.

####- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
	A concept that was solidified for me is that Sublime is the best text editor out there and I really want to learn more on how to fully optimize my usage of it. I didn't have any aha moments but I struggled for a little on merging a branch to its master on github for a while. It turned out that I didn't push the master branch itself to Github and only the branch was their. I quickly fixed this problem and was able to merge the branch successfully.

###- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	I honetly only looked at the resouces provided on the task and was able to get all the information I need to complete it. I did read eevry article throughly to make sure I understood how to complete the task.
