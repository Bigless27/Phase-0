#1.1 Think about the time reflection
While reading the many articles, I learned a lot about time management techniques. Specifically, I learned how to make habits out of tiny habits, to get in a mindset of flow, and to use meditation. Other things I learned about were time boxes such as the Pomodoro technique.

A time box is a set amount of time that you or a group of people work on a task. When the time is up whether you completed the task doesn't matter. You should reflect on what you accomplished and learned.  I currently manage my time by putting up a timer for a certain amount of time and will work until the timer goes off. It doesn't work effectively because I have been experiencing burnout from it. Also, my quality of work has suffered due to this type of management. 

I will employ a form of the time box technique. I will set the timer to around 40 minutes and take 20 minute breaks. Hopefully this helps me become more productive because my current method of time management is causing me a lot of stress. My overall plan for time management for Phase 0 would be to set a range of times per day to work. I will schedule the time slots every Monday so I know when and how long each day I need to study.  I feel this will help me complete the work in a timely manner and improve the quality of my work. 

#1.2 The Command Line
1. A shell is the user interface that you see/operate on your computer. Since we are working in terminal in this exercise, the shell we use has a command line interface. Bash is the programming language that is used in the command line interface to navigate.

2. The most challenging part was definitely memorizing the commands. I had to constantly look at my note cards for reassurance on certain commands.

3. Yes

4. Using touch to create a file or mkdir to make a directory I believe were some of the most useful commands to know. Also, adding content into file was very interesting with the use of echo "">(filename), and cat (filename) to add to the file.

5. 

pwd= Print working Directory

ls= List Directories

mv= Move a file or directory

cd= Change Directory

../ = Changes the directory to move it up one. Basically move one space out of the directory instead of moving into it.

touch= Creates a file

mkdir= Create a directory

less= page through a file

rmdir= Remove Directory

rm= remove a file

help= display help for a built in command

#1.4 Forking and Cloning 
How to create, fork, and clone a repo.

CREATE:

1. Log onto Github.com 

2. In the upper right hand corner there is your profile picture with a + sign to the left of it. Press the plus sign and click on create a new repository from the drop down menu.

3. After that you will need to give your repository a name, either switch it to a public or private repository, and edit any licensing associated with your repository (as needed).

4. Click on the button "create repository" and your all done

FORK:

1: Click on the repositories name to open it up

2: Under your profile picture will be button titled FORK. Click on that button and it will fork the repository to your account.

CLONE:

1: Look on the right side of your page and you should see a URL in a box with the words "HTTTPS Clone URL," above it.

2: Highlight the URL and copy it

3: Open your terminal and Change your directory until the working directory is where you want to place your cloned repository.

4: Type: git clone (repositories name), this will clone the repository to your specified directory

-You would fork a repository instead of creating a new one if you are working on a master code. meaning a code that is worked on by others. Forking takes a snap shot of that repository and allows you to make changes to it without affecting the original copy. This is more useful than creating a new one because you don't need to start from scratch, instead you can start from right where they left off.

- I didn't have any struggles setting up Github, it was pretty straight forward. I learned about creating new repositories on Github, how to fork other repositories on Github, and how to clone those repositories to my computer.
