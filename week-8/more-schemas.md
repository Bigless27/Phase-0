Reflection:
- A one to one database is a database that has only one object that can only have a relation with only one other object.
- I would use a one to one database for example: when I am trying to compare a captain to a ship. Each ship can have only one capatain and each captain can only have one ship.
- A many to many database is used when there are many objects that can be related to many other types of objects
- I would use a many to many example when comparing books to authors. Many different books can have many different authors and authors may have many different books.
- I took a class in college about these types of relationships, so I'm not really confused by any of these concepts.
