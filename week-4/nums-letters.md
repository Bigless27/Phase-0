- Puts returns nil and prints the output. This is printed on a new line. Also, the “s” in puts stands for string so that means that puts will always print out a string type object.
-An integer is any non-negative or fractional number. A float is a number with a decimal tenths decimal spot after it such as 17.0
-Integer division only displays the quotient of the answer. It doesn't account for any remainders. Float division does account for the remainders and prints out the quotient with the remainder added to it.The best way to explain this to someone whose never heard of this is in math terms. Treat the division like a certain math rule so it can easily be remembered and applied. </p>

```ruby
math= 1*365*24
math2=1*10*365*24*60
puts math, math2
```
