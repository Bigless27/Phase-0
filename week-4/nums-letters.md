- Puts returns nil and prints the output. This is printed on a new line. Also, the “s” in puts stands for string so that means that puts will always print out a string type object.
-An integer is any non-negative or fractional number. A float is a number with a decimal tenths decimal spot after it such as 17.0
-Integer division only displays the quotient of the answer. It doesn't account for any remainders. Float division does account for the remainders and prints out the quotient with the remainder added to it.The best way to explain this to someone whose never heard of this is in math terms. Treat the division like a certain math rule so it can easily be remembered and applied. </p>

```ruby
math= 1*365*24
math2=1*10*365*24*60
puts math, math2
```

  -Ruby handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers just like a calculator. The symbol for multiplication changes though to "*". Ruby also lets you use operations on different types of elements like "stings" and on variables.

  -Strings are any sequence of characters that are user defined with quotation marks.You can use strings for elements like names which aren't an integer function. You could also assign strings to variables. Finally, you can manipulate strings in multiple ways such as concatenation.
  -Local variables are variables that you assign in your document that are only available there. You can use local variables to save elements for later use. I would use a variable to assign an equation to so I can keep the original equation while modifying it.
  -This challenge was rather easy for me due to my prior experience in Python. I got a great review of all of the basics of Ruby.
