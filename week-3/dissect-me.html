        Version Control is an important part of software development. Anytime a group of programmers may be working on a code base, it is subject to being changed by multiple individuals. Version control acts as a way of tracking historical changes to an original copy of code, and allows you to go back to any previous versions. Git is a type of open source version control, and Github is a website that acts as a tool to using git.

      My first week has been very enjoyable. I am already learning a ton of new information. This week I was introduced to Git and Github. Git uses a version control system and you download it to your computer. Github is a open source online community that you can post your files to and have other people look at them and edit them. Version Control is another cool thing I learned about this week. Essentially what it is is just a great way to keep track of your progress with the use of different saved commits. These commits are like "screenshots" of your work and you are able to navigate back and forth through the commits. This is extremly helpful for fixing bugs in your code which can be hard to identify at times. Being able to work back and forth through the commits makes it eaiser to identify where your code took a turn for the worst. You can then start from that commit and just build off the previous code that you have entered.

  -The HTML tags that I use often are the div tags, which I also used in this challenge. 
  	I use the div tags often because it is helpful at identifying sections of code. When you
  	name an ID in a div tag it make it easier to identify the sections of code in a source view.
  -The HTML elements get laid out into the page i different sections like a header, footer, navigation, section, 
  	side bar, and aside (right side of page). The browser displays the elements in a top down fashion, and 
  	if their are nested statements it works inside out.
  -I learned about the use of snippets in sublime today. I believe that I will absolutely create more custom 
  	snippets to help optimize my HTML work. I haven't done too much research on shortcuts yet but if
  	the snippets are as helpful as the html one is than I would definitely use them.
