<ul>
  <li>(Releases are in order 1-9, going left to right.)</li>
   <li>Chrome Dev tools inspector is an amazing tool. It helps you format and position elements by showing your instant feedback. Also, it provides you with a positioning map that shows the padding, border, margin, and position.
  </li>
  <li>You can resize elements on the DOM with padding and height and width elements.</li>
  <li>Fixed positioning means that the element is on fixed relative to viewpoint. meaning it moves with your screen when you scroll up and down. <br>
    Absolute positioning is when an element is positioned relative to the nearest ancestor.<br>
    Relative positioning is when an element is positioned relative to it's normal viewpoint on the page.<br>
    Static positioning is where html positions elements by default.</li>
<li> Margins are the space between the end of your screen and the element. Borders are the space around an element, borders are in the shape of boxes. Padding is the space between the border of an element and the element. </li>
<li> This challenged really pushed my knowledge of formatting. I really has to think about some of the releases and specifically how to attack. This assignment took me a long time to complete because I was stuck on formatting the sidebar. Overall, I would say I liked this challenge because it pushed me to think more critically about how positioning works in css.</li>
